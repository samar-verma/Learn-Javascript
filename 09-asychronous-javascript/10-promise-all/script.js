// Promise.all is a method that takes an array of promises and 
// returns a single promise that resolves when all of the promises
//  in the array have resolved or rejects when any one of the promises 
//  in the array rejects. This is useful for performing multiple 
//  asynchronous operations concurrently and handling their results 
//  collectively.
